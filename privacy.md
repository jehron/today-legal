## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services to operate the App:

### Supabase

Our backend infrastructure is hosted on [Supabase](https://supabase.com). Supabase stores your account data, posts, comments, reactions, friendships, notifications, and uploaded images (profile pictures and post images). Data is protected with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies that restrict access based on friend relationships and ownership.

- [Supabase Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy)

### Google Sign-In

If you sign in with Google, we receive your display name, email address, and profile picture URL from Google. We do not access any other Google account data.

- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### Apple Sign-In

If you sign in with Apple, we receive your name and email address (only on first sign-in). Apple may provide a private relay email address if you choose to hide your email. We do not access any other Apple account data.

- [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/)

### Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)

We use APNs to deliver push notifications to your device. Your device token is stored securely and used only for delivering notifications you have opted into.

## Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored on Supabase cloud servers.
- Database access is protected by Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, ensuring users can only access their own data and content shared by their friends.
- Uploaded images (avatars and post images) are stored in Supabase Storage with access policies.
- We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.

## Your Rights and Controls

### Notification Preferences

You can control which notifications you receive in the App's settings, including notifications for new posts from friends, friend requests, friend request acceptances, comments on your posts, and replies to your comments.

### Friend Code

You can refresh your friend code at any time from your profile, which invalidates the previous code.

Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Data is removed from our servers immediately upon deletion.
